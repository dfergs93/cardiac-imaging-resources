# Cardiac Masses Protocol

**Indications:** Suspected cardiac tumor, thrombus, pericardial mass, vegetation (supplementary to echo/CT).

## Sequence Order

| # | Sequence | View | Notes |
|---|----------|------|-------|
| 1 | Localizers | 3-plane | |
| 2 | **Dark blood HASTE** | Axial stack | Mass location, morphology, extracardiac extent |
| 3 | **Cine SSFP** | 4CH, 2CH, 3CH, SAX, targeted views | Mass mobility, attachment, valve obstruction, chamber function |
| 4 | **T2 mapping** | Targeted to mass | Edema / cystic content |
| 5 | **T2 STIR** | Targeted views | High signal in hemangioma, cyst, malignant masses |
| 6 | **T1 w/o fat sat** | Targeted views | Detect T1 bright signal (fat, thrombus, hemorrhage) |
| 7 | **T1 + fat sat** | Same views | Fat suppression confirms lipomatous lesion |
| 8 | **Multi-echo T2\*** | Targeted | Iron content (rare); cystic vs. solid |
| — | — | ***Inject gadolinium (0.1 mmol/kg)*** | |
| 9 | **Dynamic perfusion** | Targeted | Enhancement kinetics — perfused vs. avascular |
| 10 | **Early post-Gd T1** | Targeted | Immediate enhancement |
| 11 | **TI Scout** | — | |
| 12 | **LGE** | SAX stack + targeted mass views | Delayed enhancement pattern |

## Mass Characterization

### Tissue Characteristics by CMR

| Feature | Low T1 | High T1 | Low T2 | High T2 | Enhances |
|---------|--------|---------|--------|---------|---------|
| Thrombus | ✓ (acute) | ✓ (subacute/chronic) | ✓ | ✗ | **No** (avascular) |
| Myxoma | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | Yes (heterogeneous) |
| Lipoma | ✗ | ✓ (fat) | ✗ | ✓ | No |
| Fibroelastoma | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | Variable |
| Hemangioma | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ ✓ | Yes (early, intense) |
| Angiosarcoma | Variable | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | Yes (heterogeneous, nodular) |
| Metastasis | Variable | Variable | Variable | Variable | Yes |
| Pericardial cyst | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ ✓ | No |

!!! tip "Thrombus Key Feature"
    Thrombus does **not enhance** on perfusion or delayed LGE. A perfused mass enhances — not a thrombus.

## Common Cardiac Masses

### Benign

| Mass | Location | Characteristics |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **Myxoma** | LA (fossa ovalis) 75%, RA 15% | Heterogeneous, mobile, jelly-like; T2 bright, variable enhancement |
| **Lipoma** | Anywhere (RA most common) | Homogeneous T1 bright, suppressed on fat sat |
| **Papillary fibroelastoma** | Valve leaflets | Tiny, mobile; best seen on echo; low T1/T2, poor CMR visualization |
| **Hemangioma** | RV free wall | Very T2 bright; early intense enhancement |
| **Rhabdomyoma** | Ventricular myocardium | Infants; multiple; tuberous sclerosis |
| **Fibroma** | IVS / LV free wall | T1 iso, T2 dark, intense LGE (dense fibrous tissue) |
| **Pericardial cyst** | Right costophrenic angle | Simple cyst; T2 bright, no enhancement |

### Malignant

| Mass | Location | Characteristics |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **Angiosarcoma** | RA, pericardium | Nodular, hemorrhagic, T2 bright; "sunray" appearance; aggressive enhancement |
| **Undifferentiated sarcoma** | LA (mimics myxoma) | Invasion, heterogeneous enhancement |
| **Lymphoma** | Pericardium, myocardium | Diffuse infiltration; preserves anatomy |
| **Metastasis** | Any chamber / pericardium | History of primary malignancy; lung, breast, melanoma most common |
| **Mesothelioma** | Pericardium | Diffuse pericardial involvement |

## Reporting Template

```
TECHNIQUE: CMR with gadolinium for cardiac mass evaluation. 
Multi-echo T1/T2/STIR sequences, dynamic perfusion, and LGE performed.

MASS:
Location: [chamber / valve / pericardium]; attachment site: [describe]
Size: XX × XX × XX mm
Mobility: [mobile / sessile / broad-based]

SIGNAL CHARACTERISTICS:
T1: [iso/hypo/hyperintense] [fat saturation: unchanged/suppressed]
T2 / STIR: [iso/hypo/hyperintense]
Perfusion: [enhances / does not enhance — avascular]
LGE: [delayed enhancement / none]

IMPRESSION:
[Most likely diagnosis] based on [location, characteristics, enhancement pattern].
[Differential considerations if applicable]
[Recommend echo correlation / TEE / surgical evaluation]
```
