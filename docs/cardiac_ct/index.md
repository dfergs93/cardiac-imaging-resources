# Cardiac CT

Scanning protocols for cardiac CT are maintained in the **[Radiology Protocol Manager](https://dfergs93.github.io/radiology-protocols/ct/cardiac)**. This page covers reporting pearls and key measurements used during interpretation.

## Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA)

### CAD-RADS 2.0 Reporting

| CAD-RADS | Stenosis | Recommendation |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| 0 | No stenosis | No CAD |
| 1 | 1–24% | Minimal, non-obstructive |
| 2 | 25–49% | Mild, non-obstructive |
| 3 | 50–69% | Moderate — functional testing recommended |
| 4A | 70–99% (1–2 vessels) | Severe — ICA or FFR-CT |
| 4B | 70–99% (LM or 3-vessel) | Severe — heart team |
| 5 | Total occlusion | |
| N | Non-diagnostic segment | |

**Modifiers:** `+HRP` (high-risk plaque), `+S` (stent), `+G` (graft), `+E` (exception), `+I` (ischemia)

!!! tip "High-Risk Plaque Features"
    Low attenuation plaque (<30 HU), positive remodeling (RI >1.1), napkin-ring sign, spotty calcification

## TAVR Planning CT

### Key Measurements

| Measurement | Method | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| **Aortic annulus** | Multi-planar (axial oblique, perpendicular to outflow) | Mean diameter, perimeter, area → derived D |
| **Annular area** | Planimetry on perpendicular plane | Guides device sizing |
| **LVOT diameter** | 3–5 mm below annulus | Important for CoreValve-type devices |
| **Sinus of Valsalva** | Widest systolic dimension | Distance from annulus to coronary ostia |
| **Coronary heights** | LCA & RCA ostial height from annulus | <10–12 mm = higher occlusion risk |
| **Sinotubular junction** | Width at STJ | |
| **Aortic root angle** | Aortic root to vertebral column | Affects fluoroscopic projection |
| **Iliofemoral access** | Minimum luminal diameter, tortuosity, calcification | MLD ≥5–6 mm for transfemoral |

!!! warning "Bicuspid Aortic Valve"
    Increased risk of paravalvular leak and annular rupture. Note raphe, cusp morphology (Sievers 0/1/2), and eccentric calcification.

## TMVR / TTVR Planning CT

- **Mitral annulus:** D-shaped, measure perimeter and area in systole (perpendicular to LVOT)
- **Neo-LVOT:** Model potential LVOT obstruction — critical if <170–190 mm²
- **Interatrial septum:** Thickness and trajectory for transseptal approach
- **Tricuspid annulus:** Saddle-shaped; measure in systole; note associated RV dilation

---

## LAAO Planning CT

!!! tip "Key Measurements"
    - **LAA ostium:** Max and min diameter + area (elliptical shape) — guides device size (+3–5 mm)
    - **LAA landing zone:** 1–2 cm from ostium; measure max/min diameter
    - **LAA morphology:** Chicken wing, cactus, windsock, cauliflower (↑ stroke risk)
    - **Thrombus:** Residual enhancement on delayed phase (60 s) excludes thrombus

---

## Pericardial Disease

| Feature | CT Finding |
|---------|-----------|
| Pericardial thickening | >3–4 mm (normally ≤2 mm) |
| Calcification | Suggest constrictive pericarditis |
| Effusion | Simple (<30 HU) vs. complex/hemorrhagic |
| Constrictive physiology | Septal bounce on retrospective cine |

## Reporting Checklist

=== "CCTA"
    - [ ] Coronary dominance
    - [ ] Proximal, mid, distal segments for each vessel
    - [ ] CAD-RADS classification + modifiers
    - [ ] Non-cardiac findings (lungs, mediastinum, liver)

=== "TAVR Planning"
    - [ ] Aortic valve morphology (tricuspid/bicuspid, calcification burden)
    - [ ] Annular dimensions (perimeter-derived D, area, max/min)
    - [ ] Sinus of Valsalva, STJ, aortic root angle
    - [ ] Coronary ostial heights
    - [ ] Ascending aorta diameter (annulus → arch)
    - [ ] Access: iliac/femoral min luminal diameter, calcification, tortuosity
