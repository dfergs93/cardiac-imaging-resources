# Device Planning CT

Planning CT reference for structural heart interventions. For scan protocols, see the **[Protocol Manager](https://dfergs93.github.io/radiology-protocols/ct/cardiac)**.

## TAVR Planning

### Aortic Annulus Sizing

Measure perpendicular to the LVOT outflow axis (coronal oblique through the three hinge points of the aortic cusps).

| Measurement | How | Notes |
|-------------|-----|-------|
| **Perimeter-derived D** | Trace annular perimeter → D = P/π | Primary sizing metric |
| **Area-derived D** | Trace annular area → D = 2√(A/π) | Cross-check |
| **Max / Min diameter** | Widest and narrowest annular diameters | Assess eccentricity |
| **Annular area** | Planimetry | Directly guides device selection |
| **LVOT D** (3–5 mm below) | Perpendicular measurement | CoreValve sizing; LVOT obstruction risk |

### Root Measurements

| Level | What | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Sinus of Valsalva | Max width (L/R/N cusps) | Must accommodate device |
| Sinotubular junction | Width | Narrow STJ constrains self-expanding devices |
| Ascending aorta | Max diameter | Sheath compatibility; ≥45 mm = surgery threshold (bicuspid) |
| Aortic root angle | Aortoventricular angle | Affects paravalvular leak risk and fluoroscopic projection |

### Coronary Occlusion Risk

| Coronary Height | Risk |
|-----------------|------|
| >15 mm | Low risk |
| 10–15 mm | Moderate — consider BASILICA |
| <10 mm | High — BASILICA or alternative approach |

!!! warning "Bicuspid AV + TAVR"
    Note raphe type (Sievers 0: no raphe; Sievers 1: 1 raphe; Sievers 2: 2 raphes). Eccentric or bulky calcification increases paravalvular leak and annular injury risk. RVSP model and calcium scoring helpful.

### Vascular Access

| Site | Min Diameter | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| CFA (transfemoral) | ≥5.5–6.0 mm (device-dependent) | Preferred; assess with ilio-femoral run |
| Iliacs | ≥5.5 mm | Look for severe tortuosity, heavy calcification |
| Subclavian | ≥6.0 mm (left preferred) | Alternative if femoral unfavorable |
| Transaortic | Direct ascending access | High-risk femoral anatomy |
| Transapical | Avoided when possible | Only if all others unsuitable |

**Access angle:** Iliofemoral angle >90° = higher risk of vascular complications.

## TMVR Planning

### Mitral Annulus Sizing

The mitral annulus is **saddle-shaped and D-shaped** — always measure in systole.

| Measurement | How |
|-------------|-----|
| Annular perimeter | Trace in systole on sagittal + coronal planes |
| Anteroposterior (AP) diameter | Mid-point from AMVL to PMVL |
| Mediolateral (ML) diameter | Intercommissural distance |
| Area | Planimetry in reformatted plane perpendicular to annular ring |
| Annular height | SAo–IVt commissural plane |

### Neo-LVOT Assessment

!!! warning "Neo-LVOT Obstruction"
    Critical pre-procedure measurement. Critical threshold: neo-LVOT area **<170–190 mm²** is high risk for obstruction.  
    Model by reformatting CT with virtual device in place; assess the triangle between device, AMVL, and IVS.

### Transseptal Planning

| Feature | Measurement |
|---------|-------------|
| Fossa ovalis thickness | Should be <4 mm for puncture |
| Height above annular plane | Aim for 3.5–4.5 cm transseptal height |
| Interatrial septum to annulus angle | Determines trajectory |

---

## TTVR Planning

Tricuspid annulus is larger, more dynamic, and non-planar than mitral.

| Measurement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| Annular perimeter | Key for sizing; measure in systole |
| AP / ML diameters | Large — often 40–55 mm |
| Annular area | |
| RV dilation | RVEDVi; affects device anchoring |
| Coaptation gap | Distance between TV leaflet free edges in systole |
| IVC / SVC anatomy | Relevant for certain devices |

---

## LAAO Planning

### LAA Anatomy

**Morphologies** (clinical relevance):

| Morphology | Description | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| Chicken wing | Sharp bend in proximal LAA | More protective against stroke? |
| Cactus | Multiple lobes off main trunk | Complex — larger device may be needed |
| Windsock | Single dominant lobe | Common |
| Cauliflower | No dominant lobe, irregular | Highest stroke risk; most challenging |

### Key Measurements

| Measurement | How | Notes |
|-------------|-----|-------|
| LAA ostium max D | Widest diameter at ostium | Device size = ostium D + 3–6 mm |
| LAA ostium min D | Narrowest diameter | Elliptical — both dimensions needed |
| LAA ostium area | Planimetry | Alternative to diameters |
| Landing zone D | 1–2 cm from ostium | Where device sits |
| LAA depth | From ostium to tip (or first bend) | Must be ≥ device length |
| LAA to LSPV | Relationship — avoid impinging PV | |

### Thrombus Protocol

!!! note "Delayed Phase (60 s)"
    Residual enhancement on delayed phase effectively excludes thrombus. Absence of fill in on delayed = LAA thrombus → do **NOT** proceed to closure until resolved.

### Watchman Device Sizing

| Scenario | Rule |
|----------|------|
| Max LAA ostium D ≤31.5 mm | Standard Watchman FLX |
| Max LAA ostium D >31.5 mm | Larger device or alternative |
| Device size | Max ostium D + 3–6 mm (8–20% compression target) |
