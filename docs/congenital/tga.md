# Transposition of the Great Arteries

## D-TGA: Post-Arterial Switch (Jatene Procedure)

**Physiology:** Aorta arises from right ventricle, pulmonary artery from left ventricle. Arterial switch repositions great vessels to anatomically correct positions.

### Post-repair Assessment

**Neo-aortic root dilation:** The native pulmonary artery (now functioning as aorta) commonly dilates.
- Measure at annulus, sinuses of Valsalva, sinotubular junction
- Progressive dilation may warrant intervention

**Neo-pulmonary stenosis (RVOTO):** 
- Right ventricle now pumps to pulmonary artery (behind aorta)
- Narrowing can develop at anastomotic site
- Assess by PC velocity; use Bernoulli equation

**Coronary anatomy:** 
- Native coronaries are re-implanted into neoaortic root
- Assess for ostial stenosis (best by coronary CT or invasive catheterization)

**Ventricular function:**
- LV is now systemic ventricle (normal location)
- May show functional decline if post-ischemic complications

## D-TGA: Post-Atrial Switch (Mustard/Senning Procedure)

*Note: This is older operative approach; fewer cases in modern practice but important for long-term follow-up*

**Physiology:** Intra-atrial baffle redirects inferior/superior vena cava to mitral valve and pulmonary veins to tricuspid valve. **Systemic RV**: RV remains systemic ventricle; bears pressure load chronically.

### Long-term Assessment (CMR focus)

**Systemic RV volume and function:**
- RV EF and EDV critical prognostic markers
- EF <40% indicates significant dysfunction
- Progressive EF decline predicts worse long-term outcomes

**Baffle complications:**
- SVC baffle stenosis (obstruction of superior vena cava pathway)
- IVC baffle stenosis (obstruction of inferior vena cava pathway)
- Baffle leak: R→L shunting allows deoxygenated blood to systemic circulation

**AV valve regurgitation:** 
- Systemic (tricuspid) regurgitation from chronic RV dilation

**Arrhythmias:** High incidence of atrial fibrillation and flutter due to stretched atria

### Monitoring

Long-term follow-up includes echocardiography and periodic CMR to assess RV decline and baffle integrity.
