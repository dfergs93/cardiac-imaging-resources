# Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)

**Four components:** VSD + overriding aorta + RVOTO + RVH

## Pre-repair

Early diagnosis via fetal echo or postnatal echocardiography. Surgical candidates typically have adequate pulmonary arteries and left-to-right shunting with cyanosis.

## Post-repair Assessment

### CMR Evaluation

| Measurement | Normal | Concern |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| RV EDVi | 80–110 mL/m² | >160 suggests progressive dilation |
| RV EF | >45% | <40% = significant dysfunction |
| Pulmonary RF | <20% | >40% = severe PR |
| LV EF | >55% | |
| QRS duration | <160 ms | >180 ms = arrhythmia risk |

### Key Findings

- **Pulmonary regurgitation:** Measure PR by 4D flow at main PA. Progressive PR leads to RV dilation; major reason for pulmonary valve replacement (PVR)
- **Residual RVOTO:** Measure by PC velocity at site of narrowing (often infundibular). Use Bernoulli equation
- **RPA stenosis:** Common post-repair. Compare LPA:RPA flow ratios
- **Aortic root dilation:** Common sequelae. Measure at annulus, sinuses of Valsalva, sinotubular junction, ascending aorta

### PVR Timing

CMR RV volumes guide PVR indication. Most centers use:
- RVEDVi >150–160 mL/m² AND/OR RF >40% as thresholds for consideration of intervention

## Complications

- Arrhythmias (sustained VT risk if QRS >180 ms)
- Aortic root aneurysm
- Left ventricular dysfunction (late finding)
- Sudden cardiac death risk in untreated severe RV dilation
