# Ebstein Anomaly

## Anatomy

**Hallmark:** Apical displacement of the septal and posterior leaflets of the tricuspid valve from normal insertion at the annulus.

**Diagnostic criterion (echo):** Displacement ≥8 mm/m² (body surface area) below the mitral valve annulus level

**Key structural feature:**
- **"Atrialized" RV:** Portion of RV (from TV insertion to AV junction) is thin-walled and contractually incompetent; functions as part of RA
- **Functional RV:** Small chamber; often hypertrophic and restricted

## Physiology

- **Tricuspid regurgitation:** Almost universal
  - Leaflets are dysplastic and may not coapt properly
  - Severity varies: mild to severe

- **Right-to-left shunting:** ASD or patent foramen ovale present in ~70% of cases
  - Permits R→L shunting if RA pressure is elevated → cyanosis
  - Cyanosis typically mild (SaO₂ often 90–95%)

- **Atrial arrhythmias:** Accessory pathways (WPW syndrome) in ~25% of Ebstein patients
  - Risk of accessory pathway-mediated tachycardia

## CMR Assessment

### Ventricular Volumes and Function

- **Measure functional RV volume** (exclude atrialized portion from RV cavity)
  - Delineate atrialization boundary by cine
  - RV EF often reduced
  - Severe dysfunction may require intervention

- **LV volume and function:** Secondary effects from RV dilation (septal bulge into LV)

### Tricuspid Regurgitation

- **Severity assessment:** 4D flow quantifies regurgitant volume and fraction
- **Pathophysiology:** Dysplastic TV with malcoaptation; may have prolapse of leaflet

### Associated Findings

- **ASD/PFO:** Screen for right-to-left shunt on 4D flow
- **Accessory pathway:** Consider electrophysiology referral if WPW pattern on ECG
- **Other structural abnormalities:** LVOTO (left ventricular outflow obstruction), pulmonary stenosis

### Atrial Enlargement

- **RA dilation:** Often marked
- **LA size:** Usually normal unless secondary LA dilation from TR

## Clinical Considerations

### Indications for Surgery

- **Symptomatic cyanosis:** SaO₂ <90%
- **Severe RV dysfunction:** RV EF <35% or significant dilation
- **Progressive arrhythmias:** Refractory to medical management
- **Paradoxical embolism risk:** Large PFO/ASD with cyanosis

**Surgical options:**
- TV repair (cone procedure) or replacement
- ASD closure (to reduce R→L shunt)
- Arrhythmia management (if WPW)

### Medical Management

- Antiarrhythmics for accessory pathway-mediated arrhythmias
- Diuretics for right heart failure
- Anticoagulation if atrial fibrillation develops

## Imaging Follow-up

Serial CMR to assess:
- RV volume and function trajectory
- TR progression
- LA/RA size changes
- Development of arrhythmias or symptoms requiring intervention
