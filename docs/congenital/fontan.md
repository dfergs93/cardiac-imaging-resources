# Fontan Circulation

## Physiology

**Goal:** Eliminate the subpulmonary ventricle; direct systemic venous return directly to pulmonary arteries (passive flow).

**Types:**
- **Atriopulmonary connection:** RA to PA (older, rarely used now)
- **Total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC):** IVC and SVC → PA (standard modern approach, often with fenestration)

**Staged approach:**
1. **Norwood procedure** (if needed): Restructure aorta; RV-to-PA shunt
2. **Glenn procedure (Stage 2):** SVC to PA (hemi-Fontan)
3. **Fontan procedure (Stage 3):** IVC to PA, completing TCPC

## CMR Assessment

### Critical Parameters

- **Single (systemic) ventricle EF and EDVi:** Primary prognostic marker
  - EF >40% is favorable
  - Progressive decline predicts worse outcomes

- **Fontan conduit flow:** Total superior + inferior systemic venous return
  - Compare to pulmonary artery flow to assess collateral flow

- **Pulmonary artery flow distribution:**
  - LPA flow
  - RPA flow
  - LPA:RPA ratio (aim for ≥0.4 for balanced distribution)

- **Pulmonary collateral flow:** Calculated as (Total PA flow) − (Fontan conduit flow)
  - Normal: <20% of systemic cardiac output
  - Significant collaterals (>20%): Bypass pulmonary vascular bed, reduce PA flow

- **Systemic venous collaterals:** Bypasses Fontan circuit
  - Porto-systemic collaterals (suggest elevated IVC pressure)
  - Scan to include abdomen/inguinal region

### AV Valve Function

- **Atrioventricular valve regurgitation:** Common and progressive
  - Quantify regurgitant fraction by 4D flow
  - Severe regurgitation increases risk of failure

### Additional Assessments

- **Ventricular function and fibrosis:** LGE helps identify early remodeling
- **Pulmonary vascular resistance markers:** Elevated Fontan pressure correlates with elevated collateral flow
- **IVC flow pattern:** Retrograde flow suggests elevated IVC pressure (poor prognosis marker)

## Fenestration

**Intentional R→L shunt:** Small connection between Fontan conduit and RA (or fenestration in baffle).
- Allows decompression of elevated venous pressure
- Trade-off: Mild cyanosis (lower SaO₂, typically 92–95%)
- **CMR findings:** Expect Qp:Qs <1.0; visible shunt on 4D flow

## Long-term Complications

- **Protein-losing enteropathy (PLE):** Albumin loss from intestinal lymphatic obstruction
  - Risk factors: Low EF, elevated Fontan pressure, severe collaterals
- **Atrial arrhythmias:** Intra-atrial reentrant tachycardia (IART) common
- **Thromboembolic risk:** Consider anticoagulation if persistent atrial fibrillation
- **Progressive ventricular dysfunction:** EF decline over years to decades
- **Hepatic cirrhosis:** Chronic venous congestion → fibrosis

## Imaging Follow-up

Serial CMR (typically yearly in young children, varies by stability) to track:
- Ventricular volume and function
- Growth of collateral vessels
- Progression of valve disease
- Signs of protein-losing enteropathy
