# Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)

## Classification

| Type | Prevalence | Location | Features |
|------|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Perimembranous** | 80% | Membranous septum | Most common; can extend into inlet or outlet |
| **Muscular** | 5–20% | Muscular septum | May close spontaneously; varies by location |
| **Outlet (Supracristal)** | 5–8% | Above pulmonary and aortic valves | Risk of aortic regurgitation |
| **Inlet (Endocardial cushion)** | 8–10% | Below AV valves | Part of AVSD spectrum |

## Hemodynamic Significance

**Shunt magnitude from CMR 4D Flow:**

| Qp:Qs | Category | Clinical Significance |
|-------|----------|----------------------|
| <1.5 | Small | Hemodynamically insignificant; unlikely to need closure |
| 1.5–2.0 | Moderate | May warrant monitoring; closure considered if progressive |
| >2.0 | Large | Significant L→R shunt; closure indicated |

## Special Considerations

**Eisenmenger Syndrome:**
- Reversed shunt (Qp:Qs <1.0) and cyanosis from fixed pulmonary hypertension
- Irreversible; closure contraindicated (would cause systemic RV afterload crisis)
- Managed medically with pulmonary vasodilators

**Aortic regurgitation:** 
- Particularly with outlet/supracristal defects
- Assess severity on cine imaging and by 4D flow

**Associated lesions:**
- Concomitant ASD in primum type
- Pulmonary stenosis (cyanotic form)

## CMR Assessment

- **Defect location and size:** Dark blood imaging (HASTE/TSE) axial stack
- **Flow calculation:** 4D flow at pulmonary artery and aorta for Qp:Qs
- **Ventricular function:** SAX cine stack of each ventricle
- **LV dilation:** Secondary to volume overload from L→R shunt

## Closure Indications

- Qp:Qs ≥1.5 (Class IIa)
- Qp:Qs >2.0 in children (Class I)
- Pulmonary hypertension without reversal (Class I)
- Absolute contraindication: Eisenmenger physiology
