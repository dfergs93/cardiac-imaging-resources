# Double Outlet Right Ventricle (DORV)

## Overview

Double Outlet Right Ventricle (DORV) is a rare but complex lesion in which **both the aorta and pulmonary artery arise predominantly or entirely from the morphologic right ventricle**. The morphologic left ventricle contributes minimal or no blood to the great arteries. Communication between the right and left ventricles via a **ventricular septal defect (VSD)** is essential for survival, as it provides the only outlet for left ventricular blood.

### Key Features

- **Both great arteries originate from the RV**: Usually >50% of each artery arises from the RV
- **Obligatory VSD**: Systemic-to-pulmonary connection essential for survival
- **Variable anatomy**: Great artery relationships (anterior–posterior, side-by-side, right-to-left) and VSD position vary widely
- **Associated lesions**: Heterotaxy, pulmonary stenosis, hypoplastic pulmonary arteries, other CHD
- **Complex surgical anatomy**: Repair strategy depends on VSD location relative to great arteries

## Segmental Anatomy

### Situs and Orientation

- Usually **situs solitus** but **heterotaxy is common** (~30% of DORV patients)
- **Levocardia** typical, but various cardiac positions possible
- Evaluate **splenic and visceral situs** carefully

### Venous Drainage

- **Systemic venous return** (SVC + IVC) typically drains to right atrium (normal)
- **Pulmonary venous return** typically drains to left atrium (normal)
- Anomalous pulmonary venous return possible; assess all four PVs

### Atrioventricular Connections

- **Concordant**: Right atrium → tricuspid valve → morphologic **right ventricle**
- **Concordant**: Left atrium → mitral valve → morphologic **left ventricle**
- AV connections are normal; abnormality is entirely at **ventriculoarterial level**

### Ventricles

- **Morphologic right ventricle** (dominant chamber):
  - Enlarged, receives blood from both atria (via tricuspid valve) and from LV (via VSD)
  - Gives rise to both aorta and pulmonary artery
  - Hypertrophied walls

- **Morphologic left ventricle** (hypoplastic, "unwedged"):
  - Small chamber, "wedged" between aortic root and ventricular septum
  - No outlet to great arteries (or minimal contribution)
  - Blood escapes via VSD to RV

- **Ventricular septal defect** (obligatory):
  - Communication between RV and LV essential for pulmonary and systemic blood flow
  - **VSD classification by position**:
    - **Subarterial (doubly committed)**: Directly under both PA and aorta
    - **Perimembranous with RV outlet extension**: Under both arteries but via membranous defect
    - **Perimembranous with inlet extension**: Rare, further from arteries
    - **Remote VSD**: Far from both great arteries; uncommon in DORV

### Ventriculoarterial Connections (Abnormal—Both from RV)

- **Aorta arises from RV**: Usually with variable degree of override from LV (typically >50% arises from RV)
- **Pulmonary artery arises from RV**: Variable position and take-off relative to aorta
- **Relationship of great arteries**:
  - **Anterior–posterior**: Aorta anterior to PA, or vice versa (most common)
  - **Side-by-side**: Aorta to the right of PA
  - **PA appears to override VSD**: Rare but possible (mimics PA-concordant physiology)

### Coronary Arteries

- Coronary ostia typically arise from expected sinuses despite abnormal great artery positions
- May be displaced or abnormally positioned in ~10–15% of cases
- **Coronary assessment critical** before surgical planning to avoid inadvertent injury during arterial transposition

### Aorta

- Arises predominantly from morphologic right ventricle
- Position variable: anterior, posterior, or side-by-side relative to pulmonary artery
- Systemic output dependent on RV contractility and VSD flow dynamics
- Monitor for:
  - Aortic regurgitation
  - Aortic root dilation (variable)

### Pulmonary Arteries

- Arises predominantly from morphologic right ventricle
- Often **hypoplastic**, especially if subaortic stenosis develops
- Pulmonary blood flow depends on:
  - RV-to-PA flow (not LV-to-PA, as LV has no PA outlet)
  - VSD **size and restrictiveness** (if small, limits pulmonary flow)
  - Degree of pulmonary stenosis if present

## DORV Classification (Surgical Perspective)

The surgical approach depends on VSD location relative to the great arteries and aortic position:

| Type | VSD Position | Aorta Position | Physiology | Surgical Approach |
|------|-------------|----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Subarterial VSD (Taussig-Bing)** | Under both PA and aorta | Anterior to PA; PA more posterior | Similar to TGA (cyanotic) | PA switch (Rastelli-like) or arterial switch |
| **Perimembranous with anterior extension** | Under aorta primarily | Usually anterior-left | L-R shunt if no LVOTO | VSD closure ± aortic repositioning; Rastelli if needed |
| **Perimembranous with posterior extension** | Under PA primarily | Usually posterior | L-R shunt; similar to VSD physiology | VSD closure ± PA outflow procedures |
| **Remote VSD** | Far from both arteries | Variable | Creates challenges | Complex repair; may need conduit |

## Hemodynamics and Associated Lesions

### Degree of Cyanosis

Depends on:

1. **VSD size**: 
   - Small VSD → Limited LV output to RV → Cyanosis
   - Large VSD → Better mixing → Less cyanosis

2. **Relative positions of aorta and PA**:
   - If aorta favors RV inlet → Better systemic output → Less cyanosis
   - If aorta is "unwedged" and primarily receives RV inlet blood → Better systemic flow

3. **Associated pulmonary stenosis**:
   - Decreases pulmonary flow → Increases cyanosis

### Associated Lesions

| Lesion | Frequency | Significance |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Pulmonary stenosis | 30–50% | Restricts pulmonary flow; worsens cyanosis |
| AV valve abnormalities | 20–40% | TV or MV dysplasia/regurgitation |
| Heterotaxy | ~30% | Situs inversus, asplenia, polysplenia, IVC anomalies |
| Left AV valve regurgitation | 10–20% | Volume overload if present |
| Hypoplastic pulmonary arteries | 20–30% | Limits surgical options |
| Aortic regurgitation | 10–20% | From VSD proximity to aortic valve |
| CoA or aortic stenosis | 5–10% | Additional LVOTO |

## CMR Imaging Pearls

### Morphologic Assessment

1. **Confirm both arteries from RV**:
   - Trace aorta and PA from their origins
   - Identify RV insertion points
   - Confirm LV does not give rise to either vessel

2. **Identify and characterize VSD**:
   - Location relative to great arteries (subarterial, perimembranous, remote)
   - Size and restrictiveness
   - Relationships to aortic and pulmonary valves

3. **Define great artery relationship**:
   - Anterior–posterior, side-by-side, or other
   - Aortic position relative to pulmonary artery crucial for surgical planning

4. **Ventricular chamber size and function**:
   - RV is dominant; measure volumes and ejection fraction
   - LV is hypoplastic; assess degree of hypoplasia
   - Measure relative chamber sizes

5. **Coronary artery anatomy**:
   - Identify origins and course of coronary arteries
   - Exclude anomalous coronaries (e.g., left coronary from right sinus)
   - May require dedicated coronary CMR

### Flow Imaging

- **4D flow** or **2D PC through great arteries**:
  - Quantify aortic and pulmonary artery flows
  - Assess VSD shunt magnitude (left-to-right typically predominates)
  - Measure pulmonary stenosis gradient if present
  - Measure aortic regurgitation if suspected

- **PC through VSD** (if imaging plane can capture):
  - Direction and magnitude of shunt
  - Peak velocity indicating restrictiveness

### LGE Assessment

- Usually minimal LGE unless associated myocarditis or fibrosis
- Assess for scar or replacement fibrosis related to complex hemodynamics

## Natural History and Clinical Presentation

### Neonates and Infants

- **Cyanosis**: Degree varies based on anatomy
- **Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1)**: Maintains ductus arteriosus to improve pulmonary blood flow if critical cyanosis
- **Balloon atrial septostomy** (Rashkind): May improve mixing if needed
- **Surgical intervention** required in first weeks to months

### Surgical Timing and Strategy

**Goals of repair**:
- Separate systemic and pulmonary circulations
- Restore aorta and PA to their appropriate ventricles (if possible)
- Alleviate LVOTO and pulmonary stenosis

**Common approaches**:

1. **Rastelli operation**:
   - For subarterial VSD or other configurations
   - VSD closure redirects LV blood to aorta
   - Conduit placed from RV to PA
   - Conduit requires future replacements as child grows

2. **Arterial switch + VSD closure**:
   - For "Taussig-Bing" anatomy
   - Rearrange great arteries + close VSD

3. **VSD closure + pulmonary artery transfer** (less common):
   - If anatomy permits

### Long-term Outcomes

- **Rastelli with conduit**: Multiple re-operations needed as child grows
- **Up to 1 in 3 patients** may need heart transplantation eventually
- **LV hypoplasia may limit ability** to restore normal circulation in some cases
- **Excellent immediate outcomes** with good surgical technique, but long-term follow-up essential

## Associated Findings and Syndromes

### Cardiac

- **Associated CHD**: Very high incidence of additional anomalies
- **Heterotaxy spectrum**: Up to 30% have heterotaxy, asplenia, or polysplenia
- **Coronary anomalies**: 10–15% have abnormal coronary origins

### Extracardiac

- **Heterotaxy syndrome**: Howell-Jolly bodies on blood smear (asplenia); increased risk of overwhelming sepsis
- **Syndromes**: Digeorge/22q11 deletion, visceral heterotaxy associations
- **Gastrointestinal**: Malrotation, asplenia/polysplenia, heterotaxy

## Prognosis and Long-Term Management

### Survival

- **Without intervention**: Inviable; affected infants die in first days to weeks
- **With surgical repair**: 
  - Early mortality ~5–10% (depends on complexity)
  - 10-year survival ~70–80%
  - Late mortality mainly from RV dysfunction, conduit failure, or need for transplantation

### Follow-up Essentials

1. **Serial RV size and function** assessment (echocardiography/CMR)
2. **Conduit assessment** (if Rastelli): Echocardiography for stenosis and regurgitation
3. **Arrhythmia monitoring**: Post-operative incision sites predispose to reentrant circuits
4. **Coronary status**: Late coronary compression or ostial anomalies
5. **Antibiotic prophylaxis** for endocarditis (lifelong, even after successful repair)

## Key Teaching Points

✓ **Both great arteries from RV**: Obligate VSD provides left ventricular outlet  
✓ **VSD anatomy determines surgical approach**: Subarterial, perimembranous, or remote affects repair strategy  
✓ **Rastelli operation**: Common strategy; requires multiple conduit replacements  
✓ **Heterotaxy frequent**: ~30% have asplenia/polysplenia; varicella vaccination important  
✓ **Complex imaging**: Careful segmental analysis and coronary assessment essential pre-operatively
