# Coarctation of the Aorta (CoA)

## Anatomy

**Location:** Narrowing of descending thoracic aorta, typically at the isthmus (just distal to left subclavian artery takeoff).

**Classification:**
- **Preductal:** Proximal to ductus arteriosus (rare; associated with hypoplastic left heart features)
- **Juxtaductal:** At the level of ductus arteriosus (most common)
- **Postductal:** Distal to ductus arteriosus

## Hemodynamics

- **Native anatomy:** Narrowing causes proximal hypertension and reduced distal flow
- **Collateral development:** Intercostal, internal mammary vessels enlarge to decompress proximal aorta (can be prominent on imaging)
- **Gradient:** By PC velocity and Bernoulli equation
  - Note: PC likely underestimates true gradient if significant collateral decompression is present

## CMR Imaging

**Morphology:**
- Axial dark blood imaging to visualize narrowing
- Sagittal reconstructions to measure coarctation shelf
- Note bicuspid aortic valve (present in ~50% of CoA)

**Flow assessment:**
- PC velocity at narrowest point
  - Mild: <2 m/s
  - Moderate–severe: >2 m/s (Bernoulli: ΔP = 4V² = >16 mmHg)
- Compare proximal (ascending aorta) vs distal (descending aorta) flow

**Aortic root/ascending aorta:**
- Measure diameter at annulus, sinuses, sinotubular junction
- Aortic root dilation common and progressive

## Associated Findings

- **Bicuspid aortic valve:** ~50% association; assess for stenosis or regurgitation
- **Hypoplastic features:** Narrowed aortic arch, underdeveloped descending thoracic aorta
- **Turner syndrome:** Increased CoA coexistence; screen for other cardiac/renal abnormalities
- **Mitral valve abnormalities:** Hypoplastic MV
- **Ventricular septal defect:** May coexist

## Post-repair Complications

### Surgical Repair (End-to-end anastomosis or patch)

- **Re-coarctation:** Narrowing at repair site; occurs in 10–20% over years
- **Aneurysm:** Especially at Dacron patch sites; risk of rupture
- **Aortic root changes:** Continued progression of dilation despite successful repair

### Balloon Expandable Stent Placement

- Effective for postoperative re-coarctation
- Complications: Residual narrowing, aortic wall perforation, stent fracture

## Hypertension Management

- Pre-repair: Often severe hypertension; medications required
- Post-repair: Hypertension may persist even after successful repair due to aortic stiffness
- Long-term monitoring essential (home BP checks, antihypertensive therapy)

## Imaging Follow-up

Serial imaging (CMR or CT) to assess:
- Residual narrowing and peak velocity
- Aortic root growth
- Development of collaterals (if re-narrowing)
- Associated lesion progression (e.g., aortic stenosis)
