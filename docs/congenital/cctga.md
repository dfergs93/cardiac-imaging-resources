# Congenitally Corrected Transposition of the Great Arteries (ccTGA)

## Overview

Congenitally corrected transposition (also called L-transposition or L-TGA) is characterized by **discordant atrioventricular and discordant ventriculoarterial connections**. Despite the abnormal morphology, the physiology is "corrected" at rest because systemic venous return ultimately reaches the lungs, and pulmonary venous return reaches the systemic circulation—however, the **systemic right ventricle** is at increased risk for ventricular dysfunction over time.

### Key Features

- **Concordance paradox**: Two levels of discordance ("double discordance") result in concordant physiology
- **L-loop ventricles**: Left-sided morphologic left ventricle (subpulmonary), right-sided morphologic right ventricle (systemic)
- **Levocardia** (normally positioned heart) with inverted chambering
- **Associated lesions** very common: VSD, left AV valve regurgitation (systemic mitral valve), Ebstein-like tricuspid deformity, subaortic stenosis, conduction abnormalities

## Segmental Anatomy

### Situs and Orientation

- Usually **situs solitus** but heterotaxy is common
- **Levocardia** with normal cardiac position despite inverted chamber arrangement
- May be associated with other situs abnormalities—evaluate carefully

### Venous Drainage

- Systemic venous return (SVC + IVC) drains to **morphologic left atrium** (on right side)
- Pulmonary venous return drains to **morphologic right atrium** (on left side)
- **Anomalous pulmonary venous return** is frequently associated—check all four pulmonary veins

### Atrioventricular Connections (Discordant)

- **Morphologic right atrium** → **mitral valve** → **morphologic left ventricle** (subpulmonary, in left position)
- **Morphologic left atrium** → **tricuspid valve** → **morphologic right ventricle** (systemic, in right position)
- **Systemic mitral valve regurgitation** is common (acts as systemic AV valve)
- **Tricuspid valve abnormalities**: Ebstein-like malposition with apical displacement and dysplasia

### Ventricles

- **Morphologic left ventricle** (subpulmonary):
  - Small, compact morphology
  - In left position (appears as "RV" on echocardiography)
  - Gives rise to pulmonary artery
  
- **Morphologic right ventricle** (systemic):
  - Dilated, thin-walled, less compliant
  - In right position (appears as "LV" on echocardiography)
  - Supports systemic circulation
  - Progressive dilation and dysfunction common in adulthood

- **Ventricular septal defect**: Present in ~70–80% of ccTGA cases
  - Usually perimembranous or subarterial
  - May partially restrict left-to-right blood flow

### Ventriculoarterial Connections (Discordant)

- **Morphologic left ventricle** (subpulmonary) → **aorta** (posteriorly positioned, arises from left-sided ventricle)
- **Morphologic right ventricle** (systemic) → **pulmonary artery** (anteriorly positioned, arises from right-sided ventricle)
- Great arteries typically **anterior–posterior relationship** or **side-by-side**

### Coronary Arteries

- **Mirror-image coronary pattern** is typical
  - Right coronary artery arises from **left-facing sinus** (anterior)
  - Left coronary system arises from **right-facing sinus** (posterior)
- Coronary ostia may be higher or in abnormal positions
- **Critical for surgical planning** (during potential future procedures)

### Aorta

- Arises from **morphologic left ventricle** (in subpulmonary position but giving rise to aorta)
- Typically **posterior and to the left** relative to pulmonary artery
- Monitor for:
  - Aortic root dilation
  - Aortic regurgitation (related to VSD anatomy or endocarditis risk)

### Pulmonary Arteries

- Branch pulmonary arteries usually patent and normally sized
- May show reduced flow if severe subaortic stenosis (left ventricular outflow tract obstruction)

## Associated Lesions

| Lesion | Frequency | Clinical Significance |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|
| VSD | 70–80% | Permits left-to-right shunt; position determines surgical approach |
| Pulmonary stenosis | 25–30% | Variable; worsens systemic RV afterload |
| Subaortic stenosis | 10–20% | LVOT obstruction; may require surgical relief |
| Left AV valve regurgitation | 40–50% | Increases systemic RV volume load; progressive |
| Tricuspid abnormality | 10–30% | Ebstein-like malposition; worsens TR |
| Conduction abnormalities | 50–80% | Heart block common; may need pacing; CNS heterotaxy may have situs inversus totalis with right-sided IVC/SVC |
| Heterotaxy/asplenia/polysplenia | 5–10% | Assess situs carefully |

## CMR Imaging Pearls

### Morphologic Assessment

1. **Recognizing the inversion**: 
   - Use systemic venous return to identify the morphologic left atrium (receives SVC + IVC)
   - Morphologic ventricle identification: trabeculae, papillary muscles, valve attachments
   - **L-loop**: Morphologic LV on left, morphologic RV on right (opposite of normal)

2. **Chamber size and function**:
   - Measure **systemic RV** volumes and ejection fraction (may be reduced)
   - Estimate **subpulmonary LV** size (usually small)
   - Quantify left (systemic mitral) and right AV valve regurgitation

3. **VSD localization**:
   - Careful cine imaging in multiple planes to define VSD type
   - Position relative to great arteries (important for operative planning)

### Flow Imaging

- **4D flow or 2D PC** through great arteries to assess:
  - Systemic-to-pulmonary shunt (if VSD present)
  - Systemic AV valve (mitral) regurgitation fraction
  - Subaortic obstruction gradient
  - Branch pulmonary artery flow balance

### LGE/Fibrosis Assessment

- Assess for myocardial replacement fibrosis in systemic RV (related to chronic volume/pressure overload)
- Fibrosis correlates with ventricular dysfunction and arrhythmia risk

### Associated Anomalies

- Pulmonary and systemic venous return anatomy
- Coronary artery origins and course (may require dedicated coronary CMR protocol)
- Situs and other congenital associations

## Clinical Staging and Natural History

### Uncorrected (Native) ccTGA

- **Presentation**: Often cyanotic if VSD absent or restrictive; may be acyanotic if large VSD provides adequate mixing
- **Young adulthood**: Systemic RV tolerates hemodynamic load reasonably well
- **Progressive dysfunction**: 25–30-year-old patients often show declining RV function and increasing valve regurgitation
- **Complications**: Arrhythmias, heart failure, endocarditis risk

### Post-Surgical (if prior intervention)

- **VSD closure** if hemodynamically significant
- **Pulmonary stenosis relief** or RV outflow tract procedures
- **Double switch operation** (rare, very young patients): Restores LV as systemic ventricle
- **Atrial switch + arterial switch** (historical, less common now)

---

## Associated Findings

### Cardiac

- **Conduction abnormalities**: ~50% have heart block (related to abnormal AV nodal location)
- **Arrhythmias**: Atrial flutter/fibrillation common in older patients; pre-excitation (WPW) possible
- **Endocarditis**: Increased risk with VSD and valve abnormalities

### Extracardiac

- **Heterotaxy**: Assess splenic position, sidedness of vena cava, lung airway anatomy
- **Cardiac malposition** (dextrocardia possible but rare in ccTGA)
- **Associated syndromes**: Down syndrome (Trisomy 21)

---

## Prognosis and Management

### Natural History

- Infants and children often cyanotic; cyanosis may improve with growth or spontaneous closure of PDA
- Adolescents and young adults generally stable if uncomplicated
- Systemic RV dysfunction typically emerges in 3rd–4th decade
- Survival to adulthood without intervention is possible but long-term outcome depends on degree of associated lesions

### Management Considerations

1. **Asymptomatic uncomplicated ccTGA with large VSD**:
   - May not require early intervention
   - Serial follow-up for RV size and function

2. **Restrictive VSD or cyanosis**:
   - Balloon atrial septostomy (Rashkind) in infancy if inadequate mixing
   - VSD closure if hemodynamically significant

3. **Progressive RV dysfunction, valve regurgitation**:
   - Afterload reduction therapy
   - Consider double switch operation (controversial; best in young children)
   - Heart transplantation if end-stage

4. **Endocarditis prophylaxis**:
   - Recommended for patients with VSD or valve abnormalities

## Key Teaching Points

✓ **Two discordances = concordant physiology**: Abnormal anatomy delivers blood appropriately but with systemic RV at risk  
✓ **Mirror-image coronaries**: Right coronary from left sinus (anterior) — critical for surgery  
✓ **Systemic RV dysfunction**: The limiting factor; emerges decades into life  
✓ **High association** with VSD, valve regurgitation, subaortic stenosis, and conduction abnormalities  
✓ **Heterotaxy is frequent**: Always assess situs and splenic position
