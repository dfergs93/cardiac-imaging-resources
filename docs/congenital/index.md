## Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)

**Four components:** VSD + overriding aorta + RVOTO + RVH

**Post-repair assessment (CMR focus):**

| Measurement | Normal | Concern |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| RV EDVi | 80–110 mL/m² | >160 suggests repair |
| RV EF | >45% | <40% = dysfunction |
| Pulmonary RF | <20% | >40% = severe PR |
| LV EF | >55% | |
| QRS duration | <160 ms | >180 ms = arrhythmia risk |

!!! tip "PVR Timing"
    CMR RV volumes guide PVR timing. Most centers use RVEDVi >150–160 mL/m² + RF >40% as thresholds.

**Reporting pearls:**
- Measure PR by 4D flow or 2D PC at main PA
- Note residual RVOTO (velocity by PC or Bernoulli)
- RPA stenosis common post-repair — compare LPA:RPA flow ratios
- Aortic root dilation is common; measure at annulus, sinus, STJ, AAo

---

## Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA)

### D-TGA (after arterial switch)

- Neo-aortic root dilation (neoAo = native PA): measure annulus, sinus, STJ
- Neo-pulmonary stenosis (RVOTO) common — use Bernoulli
- Coronary anatomy: re-implanted; assess for stenosis (coronary CT or cath)
- LV function may decline if systemic

### D-TGA (after Mustard/Senning — atrial switch)

- **Systemic RV** — RV EF and EDV critical; EF <40% = poor prognosis
- Baffle obstruction: SVC or IVC baffle stenosis
- Baffle leak: shunt on 4D flow or contrast echo
- Report: SVR EF, EDV, baffle patency, TR (systemic AV valve)

---

## Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)

**Subtypes:** Secundum (most common), primum, sinus venosus (RSPV anomalous return), coronary sinus

**Hemodynamic significance:**
- Qp:Qs >1.5 generally warrants closure
- RV dilation = sign of volume overload

!!! tip "4D Flow in ASD"
    Qp:Qs from PA vs Ao net flows. Also look for anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (sinus venosus ASD → always check RSPV)

**Sizing for closure:** Measure balloon-stretched diameter on TEE, but CT/CMR provides anatomic rim assessment

---

## Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)

**Subtypes:** Perimembranous (most common), muscular, outlet (supracristal), inlet (AVSD)

| Qp:Qs | Category |
|-------|----------|
| <1.5 | Small — unlikely to need closure |
| 1.5–2.0 | Moderate |
| >2.0 | Large — closure indicated |

**Eisenmenger:** Reversed shunt (Qp:Qs <1.0) with fixed pulmonary hypertension — irreversible.

---

## Fontan Circulation

**Physiology:** No sub-pulmonary ventricle; systemic venous blood flows passively to lungs.

**CMR assessment:**
- Single ventricle EF and EDVi
- Fontan conduit flow (SVC + hepatic IVC → PA)
- Pulmonary artery flows (LPA, RPA, total Qp)
- Collateral flow = Qp − Fontan flow (>20% = significant)
- AV valve regurgitation (systemic)
- Protein-losing enteropathy risk if EF low + elevated Fontan pressures

!!! warning "Fenestration"
    A fenestration = intentional R→L shunt. Expect Qp:Qs <1.0. Note R→L shunting on 4D flow.

---

## Coarctation of the Aorta (CoA)

**Key imaging points:**
- Narrowing at isthmus (distal to LSCA origin)
- Collateral vessels: internal mammary, intercostal
- Gradient by 4D flow / PC velocity → Bernoulli (but underestimates collateral decompression)
- Bicuspid aortic valve in ~50%
- Ascending aorta dilation common

**Post-repair:** Re-coarctation, aneurysm at repair site (especially Dacron patches)

---

## Ebstein Anomaly

- Apical displacement of septal/posterior TV leaflets (≥8 mm/m² from MV insertion)
- "Atrialized" RV = dilated, incorporated into RA
- CMR: functional (true) RV volume and EF, TR severity, ASD/PFO (70%)
- Associated WPW (right-sided accessory pathway)

---

## AVSD (AV Septal Defect)

- Primum ASD + inlet VSD + common AV valve
- Common in Down syndrome
- Left AV valve regurgitation common post-repair
- CMR: LV volume, LAVV regurgitant fraction, LVOTO (goose-neck deformity)

## MRI Tips for CHD

!!! tip "General Approach"
    1. **Morphology first** — dark blood (HASTE/TSE) axial stack for situs, connections, great vessel relationships
    2. **Cine function** — SAX stack of each ventricle (measure volumes separately)
    3. **Flow** — 2D PC or 4D flow at Ao, PA, LPA, RPA, any shunt vessel
    4. **LGE** — assess fibrosis, especially in systemic RV patients
    5. **T1/T2 mapping** — if myocarditis, infiltrative, or congestive hepatopathy suspected

**Breath-holding:** Use free-breathing with respiratory navigator for uncooperative patients or complex anatomy requiring long sequences.

**Sedation / anesthesia:** Required for young children; coordinate with anesthesia for timing of sequences.
