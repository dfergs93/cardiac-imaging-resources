# Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)

## Classification

| Type | Prevalence | Key Features |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **Secundum** | 70% | Central defect in fossa ovalis; most common |
| **Primum** | 15% | Lower, involves AV valve tissue; part of AVSD spectrum |
| **Sinus venosus** | 10% | Defect near SVC or IVC; often with anomalous PV return |
| **Coronary sinus** | 5% | Rare; drain to coronary sinus |

## Hemodynamic Significance

**Shunt magnitude from 4D Flow:**
- **Qp:Qs <1.5:** Small defect, typically asymptomatic; closure not routinely indicated
- **Qp:Qs 1.5–2.0:** Moderate; warrants monitoring
- **Qp:Qs >2.0:** Large; generally indicated for closure to prevent RV dilation and late complications

**Volume overload signs:**
- RV dilation
- RA enlargement
- LV compression (RV dilation in diastole)

## 4D Flow Assessment

- **Qp:Qs calculation:** Pulmonary artery net flow vs aortic net flow
- **Shunt location:** 4D flow can visualize the actual defect and shunt vector
- **Anomalous pulmonary venous return:** Especially in sinus venosus ASD (right upper PV commonly drains to SVC)

## Closure Consideration

**Sizing for transcatheter closure:**
- TEE provides stretched balloon diameter (hemodynamic)
- CT/CMR provides static anatomic measurements of rims and defect diameter
- Adequate rims needed for device stability (usually >5 mm)

**Surgical closure:** If anatomy unsuitable for device (rims too short, multiple defects, or PV anomaly requiring surgical correction)

## Long-term Follow-up

Post-closure assessment by echocardiography or cardiac CT to ensure device position and assess for residual shunting.
